The code is designed to work with 2 ultrasonic sensors and 2 light intensity sensors.
The ultrasonic sensors should be placed so that one can detect blocks.
Thus, 1) Placed lower and closer to the ground
      2) Detect a flag at the disposal site. To avoid interference with the blocks, both the
         sensor and flag should be at a greater height

The intensity sensors can be placed any where in the front of the robot
The chassis is also open to your imagination
Finally, the Lego MindStorms limit the use of 3 motors. Thus, to operate the clamp with one motor
a gear mechanism can be created to operate two claws symmetrically. This can be seen in the pictures 
in this repo.

Thanks for reading!
